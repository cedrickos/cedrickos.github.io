Greetings!


<img style="float: left;" src="images/Thenardite_Bulk3M.jpg" alt="MacroThenardite" width="200"/>
My name is Cedrick and I am a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Chemistry at the University of Leeds. I work in Prof. Fiona Meldrum's laboratory and I am part of the Crystallisation in the Real World consortium.
