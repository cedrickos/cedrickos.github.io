<p style="color:DodgerBlue;background-color:lightblue;border-left-style: solid;border-color:DodgerBlue;"><b>My name is Cedrick and I am a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Chemistry at the University of Leeds. I work in Prof. Fiona Meldrum's laboratory and I am part of the Crystallisation in the Real World consortium. I am currently interested in many different aspects of crystallisation including: confinement, surface induced and nucleants.</b></p>
