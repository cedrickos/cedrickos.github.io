          Confinement

          Crystallisation in the real world often happens in a confined space
          rather than in a bulk solution. For instance, the crystallisation of
          biominerals, the development of nanomaterials and the formation of
          weathering products in porous media all occur under confinement.
          The thermodynamics and kinetics of the system are dramatically altered
          in these settings. Due to these differences I am interested in the
          effects of confinement on a multiple topics: (i) crystallisation
          pathway, (ii) polymorph selection, (iii) crystal morphology, and (iv)
          surface chemistry.

          Amorphous materials

          Amorphous materials are incredibly important in a range of geological
          environments ranging from carbonates and silicates produced through
          biologically activity to volcanic glasses. Their technological applications
          are also numerous; from bioactive glasses, nuclear waste containment,
          photovoltaic cells, etc. In order to understand and eventually design
          materials with given properties the characterisation of their microstructure
          is of fundamental importance. Due to these materials' lack of periodicity
          typical characterisation techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, are
          rendered useless. Thus, a variety of spectroscopic techniques must be
          used to attempt to quantify the chemical speciation and structure of these
          complex materials. My interests lie mainly in the characterisation of
          vitreous samples using a combination of Raman and X-ray spectroscopic
          techniques to elucidate these structures.

          Porous materials form a very special subset of solids which are distinct
          from typical materials by their distribution of empty space within them.
