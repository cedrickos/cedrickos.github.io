      My name is Cedrick and I am a postdoctoral fellow in the School of
      Chemistry at the University of Leeds. I work in Prof. Fiona Meldrum's
      laboratory and I am part of the Crystallisation in the Real World
      consortium. I am currently interested in many different aspects of
      crystallisation including: confinement, surface induced and nucleants.
